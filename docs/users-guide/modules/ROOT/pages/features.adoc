:navtitle: How Grenki Can Help

== Agile and secure

*Automate the assembly of your secure, nimble static site as changes happen instead of wrestling with a CMS giant.*

Rebuild and deploy your site automatically in a matter of seconds in response to any change.

== SQL: Minimal markup, maximum functionality

*Document using an intuitive syntax designed specifically for technical documentation that's lightweight, yet comprehensive.*



== Navigation as content

*Describe the documentation navigation using AsciiDoc lists.*

Writers using Antora can feel right at home when defining navigation.
Why?


== Interchangeable UI

*The site's user interface and theme is maintained separately from the content.*



== Sensible defaults. Open architecture.

*Start with the default.*
